# mypokejournal

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to log pokemon sightings to a Pokemon journal entry of one day.
The user can use the search bar to type in the name of a pokemon. Then the application will fetch data from the API PokeApi and display the name and type of the Pokemon onto a card on the page. It will also display an image of the pokemon, 
which when clicked will toggle between an image of the back and front of the pokemon. Within each individual Pokemon's card, there will also be a
comment bar to add field notes about that particular sighting, a button to remove comments and and a counter to show how many were seen in that day.
There is also a delete button that will remove a pokemon's card. 
On the bottom of the page is a counter that shows how many different species were seen based on how many cards the user adds to the page.
