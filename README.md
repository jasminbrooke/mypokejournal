# mypokejournal

The purpose of this application is to simulate a Pokemon journal entry of one day, in the style of a bird journal. 
The user can use the search bar to type in the name of a pokemon. Then the applcation will fetch data from the API PokeApi and 
display the name and type of the Pokemon onto a card on the page. It will also display an image of the pokemon, 
which when clicked will show an image of the back of the pokemon. within each individual Pokemon's card, there will also be a
comment bar to add field notes about that particular sighting, and a counter to show how many were seen in that day.
There is also a delete button that will remove a pokemon's card.
